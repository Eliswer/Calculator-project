# React calculator project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

I have made this advanced calculator project with 'crate-react-app', with a button and a smooth animation you can switch between normal and advanced calculator.
I work with components and props.
